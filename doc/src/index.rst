===================================================
basisopt : quantum chemistry basis set optimization
===================================================

About
=======

BasisOpt is an open-source library for the optimization of gaussian basis sets, for use in quantum chemistry calculations. We aim to offer:

* a software-agnostic interface to allow for reproducibility  
* automation of the optimization procedure
* methods for evaluating and visualising basis sets
* a framework for the development of new optimization methods
* standardised format for presenting basis set optimization results

It was written predominantly by Robert Shaw (@robertshaw383), with assistance from Grant Hill (@Dr_GHill), as part of an EPSRC-funded project at the University of Sheffield.
