Installation
============

We are currently working on building ``conda`` and PyPI packages for BasisOpt. In the meantime, it can be installed quite simply from source.

Install from Source
-------------------

Clone the repository from `github
<https://github.com/robashaw/basisopt>`_::

    git clone https://github.com/robashaw/basisopt.git
    cd basisopt
    python setup.py install

If you would instead like to install `in place`, you can replace the last line with::

	pip install -e .

Dependencies
------------

There are fairly minimal requirements, and versions listed are minimum tested versions. Older versions _may_ work but are untested. The exception is Mendeleev where upstream changes mean we currently require version 0.9; this will hopefully be fixed soon.  

* python >= 3.9
* colorlog >= 4.1 
* numpy >= 1.21.6
* scipy >= 1.8.1
* matplotlib >= 3.3
* pandas >= 1.3.5
* monty >= 2022.4.26
* mendeleev == 0.9.0
* basis_set_exchange >= 0.9

You will also need a quantum chemistry backend. Currently supported codes are:

* Psi4 : version 1.4 or above
* ORCA : version 4.2.x or version 5.x 

There will eventually be a tutorial on how to implement wrappers for different packages. If you do, please consider submitting a pull request so that others may benefit. 
  
Testing
-------

We use ``pytest`` for our CI::

    cd basisopt
    pytest

Documentation
-------------

To build this documentation locally, make sure you have the following packages

* Sphinx >= 2.1.2

In the ``doc`` directory, run the following::
	
	mkdir build
	sphinx-build src/ build/ 

This will by default create HTML; to make other formats, consult the ``sphinx-build`` documentation.
